Analysis of yearly rental revenue data as part of a Thinkful Data Analytics case study for Lariat Car Rental.

## The Process
First, I examined and cleaned historical sales data using Excel (VLookUp, Pivot Tables/Charts, KPI metrics) and organized it all into easy to understand and access worksheets. I completed exploratory data analysis to identify strategic scenarios to increase revenue, assessed by KPI
performance. I then designed and presented models that showcased 10% - 30% increase in profits, while lowering operational costs.
